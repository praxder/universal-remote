## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Device management screens
The Manage Devices mode SHALL present a "Devices" ASCII-art banner, the saved devices, and an always-present add entry as the last row of the list, backed by the device store and exposing add, edit, and delete. When one or more devices are saved, the mode SHALL list the devices first, then a separator, then the add entry; when no devices are saved, the list SHALL show only the add entry. Selecting the add entry — by Enter or by mouse click — SHALL open device discovery (see the "Add device via discovery" requirement). Selecting a device row — by Enter or by mouse click — SHALL open that device for editing. Deleting a device SHALL be triggered either by the Backspace key while a device row is highlighted on the list, or by a Delete button on the edit screen (shown only when editing a device, never when adding), and SHALL require the user to confirm before the device is removed: the system SHALL present the same confirmation prompt naming the device, remove the device only when the user confirms, and leave the store unchanged when the user cancels. When deletion is confirmed from the edit screen, the application SHALL return to the saved-device list, which SHALL no longer show the removed device. The confirmation prompt SHALL default keyboard focus to its cancel action and SHALL let the user move focus between its confirm and cancel actions with the arrow keys. Pressing Backspace while the add entry is highlighted SHALL do nothing. The add and edit screen SHALL present an ASCII-art banner titled "Add Device" when adding and "Edit Device" when editing, styled with the same top and bottom margin as the "Devices" banner. The add and edit screen SHALL order its cells as device type, then name, then IP address. When adding, the device type SHALL be a selector offering the registered platforms by their human-readable names and defaulting to the first; when editing, the device type SHALL be shown as a read-only cell while the name and IP address remain editable. When editing, the screen SHALL show a Delete button below Save, aligned to the same left edge; the add screen SHALL NOT show a Delete button. The device-type cell, the name and IP address cells, the Save button, and — when editing — the Delete button SHALL be reachable both by Tab and by the Up and Down arrow keys — Up moves focus to the previous cell and Down to the next — while the Left and Right arrows continue to move the text cursor within a focused input. Because the Up and Down arrows navigate between cells, the device-type dropdown SHALL open on Enter or Space rather than on an arrow key. The Save button's left edge SHALL be aligned with the cells above it.

#### Scenario: Devices listed above the add row
- **WHEN** the user opens Manage Devices with one or more saved devices
- **THEN** the saved devices are displayed first, followed by a separator, then an add entry as the last row

#### Scenario: First run shows only the add entry

- **THEN** the application opens the device discovery screen and a scan begins

#### Scenario: Selecting a device edits it
- **WHEN** the user selects a device row by Enter or by mouse click
- **THEN** the application opens that device in the edit flow

#### Scenario: Backspace prompts for delete confirmation
- **WHEN** the user highlights a saved device row and presses Backspace
- **THEN** the application shows a confirmation prompt naming that device
- **AND** the device is still present in the store while the prompt is open

#### Scenario: Confirming removes the device
- **WHEN** the confirmation prompt is shown and the user confirms the deletion
- **THEN** the device is removed from the store and the list refreshes without it

#### Scenario: Cancelling keeps the device

- **THEN** no device is removed and the list is unchanged

#### Scenario: Confirmation buttons navigable by arrow keys
- **WHEN** the confirmation prompt is shown and the user presses an arrow key
- **THEN** keyboard focus moves between the confirm and cancel actions

#### Scenario: Backspace on the add entry does nothing
- **WHEN** the add entry is highlighted and the user presses Backspace
- **THEN** no confirmation prompt is shown and no device is removed

#### Scenario: Edit screen offers a Delete button
- **WHEN** the user opens the edit flow for a saved device
- **THEN** a Delete button is shown below the Save button

#### Scenario: Delete button prompts for the same confirmation
- **WHEN** the user activates the Delete button on the edit screen
- **THEN** the application shows the same delete-confirmation prompt naming that device
- **AND** the device is still present in the store while the prompt is open

#### Scenario: Confirming delete from the edit screen returns to the list
- **WHEN** the delete confirmation raised from the edit screen is confirmed
- **THEN** the device is removed from the store
- **AND** the application returns to the saved-device list, which no longer shows the removed device

#### Scenario: Cancelling delete from the edit screen keeps the device
- **WHEN** the delete confirmation raised from the edit screen is cancelled
- **THEN** no device is removed and the user remains on the edit screen

#### Scenario: Add screen has no Delete button
- **WHEN** the user opens the add flow
- **THEN** no Delete button is shown

#### Scenario: Add and edit screens show an ASCII-art banner
- **WHEN** the user opens the add flow or the edit flow
- **THEN** the screen shows an ASCII-art banner reading "Add Device" or "Edit Device" respectively, with the same top and bottom margin as the "Devices" banner

#### Scenario: Cells ordered device type, name, then IP
- **WHEN** the user opens the add flow or the edit flow
- **THEN** the first cell is the device type, the second is the name, and the third is the IP address

#### Scenario: Device type is read-only when editing
- **WHEN** the user opens the edit flow for a saved device
- **THEN** the device type is shown as a read-only cell that cannot be changed or focused
- **AND** the name and IP address cells remain editable

#### Scenario: Device-type dropdown shows human-readable labels
- **WHEN** the user opens the add flow
- **THEN** the device-type selector lists the registered platforms by their human-readable names rather than their platform identifiers

#### Scenario: Arrow keys move focus between cells
- **WHEN** a cell or the Save button is focused and the user presses the Down arrow
- **THEN** focus moves to the next cell or the Save button
- **AND** pressing the Up arrow moves focus to the previous cell

#### Scenario: Device-type dropdown opens with Enter or Space
- **WHEN** the device-type cell is focused in the add flow and the user presses Enter or Space
- **THEN** the platform dropdown opens for selection

#### Scenario: Save button aligned with the cells
- **WHEN** the user opens the add flow or the edit flow
- **THEN** the Save button's left edge lines up with the left edge of the cells above it
